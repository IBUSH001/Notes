==CS317 Notes: 02/15/2019==
Requirements for running C files through GitPod
* Make sure you're in the right folder
* Use "g++ fileName.cpp" to compile
* Run program with "./outputFileName
===General Notes===
* Class will start at 3pm on Monday the 18th
* No class on March 1
* Have minimal viable product ready by Monday
* Ultimate goal: print the chances of you winning the game (with some error bars)
* Pragmas: C++ comments
* We'll go over parallelism & high-performance computing
===Code Formatting Tool==
* Ensure uniformity across programming teams
* C++ doesn't have an official style, unlike Java
* Clang is the formatting standard for C++
* Don't change style format options, live with the standard options for at least a few weeks before changing defaults
* You can integrate Clang into your IDE or git flow: follow the instructions
** Type in clang format within the terminal
===Measuring Time Code===
* Since processors are now more complicated, and programs have to compete for code, there needs to be other methods to run the code
* Distributions of timing results is a more accurate reference point
* Resources to check: Scientific Benchmarking of Parralel Computing Systems
* Figure out where time is spent to determine where to optimize
===Solitaire Simulation===
* Time the total run time for the code
* chrono library can be used to measure time length on C++
